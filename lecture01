What is version control system ?

Building a software requires various tools and while building a software , all engineers need to work collaratively . Now while working on building the software , we need 
some special checkpoints , where we could directly start working on the software from that point itself. Its just like saving a game , like we have different checkpoints
in a game. This whole thing is called as Version Control System.
